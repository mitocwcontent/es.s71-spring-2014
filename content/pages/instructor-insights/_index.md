Instructor Insights

{{< quote "We need to think anew about the profundity of the fact that we’re physical beings in a physical world. As exquisitely attuned and highly evolved organisms, it is our physical and social interactions that form the basis of what we call 'mind.' And, students should have access to a targeted, educational opportunity to cultivate such 'root level' skills." "—Noah Riskin" >}}

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 4 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 25 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   The first 5-10 minutes of each session were spent doing warm-up exercises that focused on using the whole body.
*   Next, the instructor typically introduced students to a focal topic (such as gravitation or proprioception) in a mini-seminar; these introductions included visual representations of the topic and discussion.
*   After the introduction, students physically explored the focal topic through structured activities in the gym.
*   The final 5-10 minutes of each session were used for cool-down exercises.

Open Gym Period
---------------

*   Met 1 time per week for 1 hour per session; 14 sessions total; optional attendance.
*   Students used the open gym time to practice exercises learned in class and to receive individualized assistance from the instructor.

Out of Class
------------

Students worked on their [weekly video journal assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) and practiced warm-up and cool-down exercises.
